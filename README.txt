This repository is a combination of the things I learned in Core Java, Generics to be precise and Git/Github Lessons from
Udacity. If you're a begginner like me, or you want me to be your apprentice in this subjects then please contact me. I would love to
learn and collaborate with people. In case you want to know where I learned the basics of Git/Github I recommend Udacity courses.
I'll post it here.

I am looking forward to learn more about git/github and Java Development.
