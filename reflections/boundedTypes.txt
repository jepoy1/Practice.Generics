Bounded Types:

-- When does this usually occur?
  >When you want to create a generic class whereas you want to accept arrays,list of different type parameters(See SummaryLessons.txt).
  For example you created an generic class that accepts array Object that accepts float, integer, double values and return its average.
  
-- What does Bounded Types do?
  > (1)You need some way to tell the compiler that you intend to pass only numeric types to Generic Class. 
  (2)Furthermore, you need some way to ensure that only numeric types are actually passed.
  
-- How to do Bounded Types?
When specifying a type parameter, you can create an upper bound that declares the superclass from which all type arguments 
must be derived. This is accomplished through the use of an extendsclause when specifying the type parameter.
  ex. class Stats<T extends Number>
  - This specifies that <T> can only be replaced by superclass or subclasses of superclass(Anything that inherits Number class, in
  this example. UPPER BOUND - the superclass.
  
  - In this version, the type argument<T> must either be a class derived from Number class.
